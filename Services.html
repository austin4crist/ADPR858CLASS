                    <p> My proven media strategy was instrumental in driving the success of Trend 100.9 FM, positioning it as the number 1 radio station in the Southern region of Nigeria.

                        As the Head of Marketing and Strategy at Trend 100.9 FM, I made significant contributions to the station's success. Where I led and executed all marketing, communication, and advertising strategies, resulting in increased revenue generation and brand recognition.
